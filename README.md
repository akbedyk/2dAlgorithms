# A curve decimating algorith

 * This is test & showcase of the algorithm of decimating on a curve Y = F(x).
 * 
 * There are basic steps:
 * 1. Draw a random path function in X|Y Axis on the canvas
 * 2. Find key points
 * 3. Delete some garbage points
 * 4. Show results, calculate %
 *
 * This algorithm is close to the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm on a curve.
